"""
Python class to show a "fuzzy clock".
Homepage of the original: http://home.gna.org/fuzzyclock/
Project Page of the original: http://gna.org/projects/fuzzyclock

The class is based on a port from PHP code by
Henrique Recidive <henrique at recidive.com> which was
in turn based on the Fuzzy Clock Applet of Frerich Raabe (KDE).
So most of the credit goes to this guys, thanks :-)
